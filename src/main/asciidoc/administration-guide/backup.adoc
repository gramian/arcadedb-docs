=== Backup of a Database

ArcadeDB allows to execute a non-stop backup of a database while it is used without blocking writes or affecting performance.
You can execute the backup of a database from SQL.

Look at <<sql-backup-database,Backup Database SQL command>> for more information.

==== Configuration

- `-f <backup-file>`        (string) filename of, or path to the backup file to create.
- `-d <database-path>`      (string) path on local filesystem where to find the ArcadeDB database.
- `-o`                      (boolean) true to overwrite the backup if already exists.
If false and the `backup-path` already exists, an error is thrown.
Default is false.

==== Cloud Backups

In a container setting it may become necessary to send backups to an S3 bucket instead of a mounted volume.
Currently, ArcadeDB does not support writing a backup to S3 directly, but there are two ways of achieving this:

1. Using an intermediary container which forwards a volume's contents to an S3 bucket.
   The project https://github.com/elementar/docker-s3-volume[docker-s3-volume] makes this easy.

2. Mounting an S3 bucket inside the ArcadeDB container directly with the https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse[S3 file system via filesystem in userspace].
